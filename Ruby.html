					Ruby was designed and developed starting in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro 'Matz' Matsumoto. Matz created Ruby to be productive and fun compared with other programming languages. He felt that the design of a programming language should revolve first around the human and second around the computer. Ruby is an <strong>object-oriented, dynamic, general-purpose, programming language</strong> that has a wide user base and a growing following.

						<h3>Object Oriented</h3>
						<p>
							Ruby is an object-oriented programming language with classes that define object attributes and behaviors. Objects can inherit attributes and behaviors from parent objects, which is a powerful feature of object-oriented design.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="blurb thirds">
						<h3>Dynamic</h3>
						<p>
							Ruby is dynamic in that methods and objects can be manipulated and extended at run-time. Classes are never truly cemented down in Ruby as methods and attributes can be added while the program is running if necessary.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="blurb thirds">
						<h3>General Purpose</h3>
						<p>
							Ruby is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)#Features" target="_blank">full-featured</a> programming language that can be used in many situations. It is particularly useful as the server-side solution in web development.

					<div class="infoHeader"><h2>Why Ruby?</h2></div>
					<p class="sectIntro center">Ruby seems to cause a lot of divisiveness in the development community. Some hail its advantages as the Second Coming of programming that solve all problems, whereas others complain that it has some serious deficiencies that make it not worth using at all.</p>

						<div class="blurb half">
							<h3>Pros</h3>
							<p>Proponents of Ruby love its flexibility and balance. See the list below for a few of the best features of Ruby, including some examples.</p>
							<ol>
								<li><a href="object_example.html" target="_blank">Everything is an object!</a></li> <!-- These examples will eventually open in a lightbox -->
								<li><a href="flexibility_example.html" target="_blank">Ruby is extremely flexible</a></li>
								<li><a href="block_example.html" target="_blank">Blocks</a></li>
								<li><a href="mixin_example.html" target="_blank">Mixins</a></li>
								<li>Lack of special characters</li>
								<li>Rails (fast and easy web app development)</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Cons</h3>
							<p>Detractors of Ruby argue that the below items make it not worth using. (You can read <a href="http://www.zohararad.com/2012/11/16/10-reasons-not-to-use-ruby/">this article</a> for a Ruby lovers rebuttal to each of the bullets below). </p>
							<ol>
								<li>Ruby is not as mature as Java, PHP, etc.</li>
								<li>Ruby has subpar performance</li>
								<li>Ruby and Windows don't play nice together</li>
								<li>Ruby isn't as popular/common as PHP</li>
								<li>Ruby users are condescending and snobbish</li>
								<li>Ruby is too opinionated and forces developers to adopt designs</li>
								<li>Ruby is not as reliable as languages like Java and C#</li>
								<li>Ruby cannot handle the enterprise</li>
								<li>Ruby can't scale</li>
								<li>Skilled Ruby developers are hard to come by</li>

					<p class="sectIntro center">
						Ruby is most often used in the wild with the web application framework <a href="Rails.html"><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong></a>. Rails is an open-source framework that was first released in 2003 and helps to make developing web applications a dreamier experience.
					</p>

							<h3 class="infoSubHeader">Companies Utilizing Ruby</h3>
							<p>
								Largely because of the aforementioned Ruby on Rails framework, Ruby is gaining popularity in the industry. Businesses can leverage the productivity that Rails offers to stand-up web applications extremely quickly, making Ruby an attractive choice for projects. Some notable companies that use Ruby:
								<ul>
									<li><a href="http://github.com">Github</a></li>
									<li><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>
									<li><a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a></li>
									<li><a href="http://moneydesktop.com">Money Desktop</a></li>
								</ul>
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="blurb half">
							<h3 class="infoSubHeader">Careers with Ruby</h3>
							<p>
								A quick search for the keyword 'Ruby' on <a href="http://www.dice.com/job/results?caller=basic&q=ruby&x=al&p=">Dice.com</a> results in roughly 2300 available jobs. This is a fairly small number when compared to some other, more mature langauges, such as the following:
								<ul>
									<li><a href="http://www.dice.com/job/results?caller=searchagain&q=java&x=al&p=">Java</a> - 15000 jobs</li>
									<li><a href="http://www.dice.com/job/results?caller=searchagain&q=c%23&x=al&p=">C#</a> - 8000 jobs</li>
									<li><a href="http://www.dice.com/job/results?caller=searchagain&q=python&x=al&p=">Python</a> - 4000 jobs</li>
									<li><a href="http://www.dice.com/job/results?caller=searchagain&q=php&x=al&p=">PHP</a> - 3000 jobs</li>
								</ul>
								There is not an over-abundance of jobs that make learning Ruby an absolute economic motivator, but it is growing and desired. Certainly having Ruby as an additional skill is attractive to any potential employers.
